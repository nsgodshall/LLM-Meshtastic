We ran 1b last night on my laptop to get a feel for it

Okay but I think youâ€™re already on the next step which is: once we have it going, what do we do with it

There's also an article on what the largest one that will run on a raspberry pi is 

We had some ideas!

But some kinks need to be worked out
Edited5:26 PM

One thing we wanted to try doing is connecting it to a meshtastic node and letting it talk to people over the radio. Doing a touring test to see how long it takes people in the discord to realize it's not human

The internal monologue is the only problem with that idea, we were able to get it to behave the way we wanted it over last night with its final responses, it was just including its thinking model log in the output. 

I got it to wrap the response in a python wrapper which made it slightly easier to identify, but it mentioned the wrapper in the reasoning portion

So there's definitely still some kinks to work out, but I figure Nick might be able to help with that part

Well I have to do a few things but I can come over after that if it works? Or is this a NSL venture?

I uploaded the manual for a security camera and told it I was a security researcher and needed to come up with attack vectors and it just went ham

Yes come over we will figure it out

I Ran 9 Popular LLMs on Raspberry Pi 5; Here's What I Found
I ran some very basic to seriously powerful AI models on the Raspberry Pi 5. The result in not very unsurprising.
